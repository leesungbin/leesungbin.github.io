# Getting Started "RUST"

Local documentation : `rustup doc`

> 1. hello_rust & 2. hello_cargo



## Hello World!

```rust
// main.rs
fn main() {
  println!("Hello world!");
}
```

```shell
rustc main.rs
```

* "main" function is program's entry point.



## Cargo

rust는 오직 rustc 명령어로 컴파일한다.. 이 작업을 모든 rs 파일에 대해서 진행한다? 그럴 수 없다

> Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call libraries your code needs *dependencies*.)

```shell
cargo new hello_cargo
```



* cargo.toml

> toml : Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language

: Cargo's  configuration format

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["iseongbin <lsb918@uos.ac.kr>"]
edition = "2018"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

The last line,  `[dependencies]`, is the start of a section for you to list any of your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as *crates*.

> Cargo expects your source files to live inside the *src* directory. The top-level project directory is just for README files, license information, configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and everything is in its place.



```shell
# build project
cargo build

# how to run?
./target/debug/hello_cargo
# or just
cargo run
# building for release
cargo build --release

# to check code to make sure it compiles, but doesn't produce executable.
# Rust는 빌드 속도가 느리므로,
# cargo check를 통해서 파일이 컴파일 되는지를 빠르게 확인함으로써
# 프로젝트의 진행속도를 높일 수 있다.
cargo check
```

* Cargo.lock file keeps track of the exact dependencies of the project.
