# References and Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  
  let len = calculate_length(&s1); // rather than returning tuple (String, usize);
  
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: $String) -> usize {
  s.len()
} // s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what it refers to, nothing happens.
```

> Passing *references* : allows to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.

* opposite of referencing : deferencing with operetor `*`

* If we try to modify something that we've *borrowed*, it doesn't work!

  Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references.



### Mutable References

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello");
  
  change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) P
some_string.push_str(", world");
```

**Only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope.**

* Benifit of having this restriction : Rust can prevent data races at compile time.
  * when data races occur:
    * Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
    * At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
    * There's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

* Also, we cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one.
* But, multiple immutable references are okay.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
println!("{} {}", r1, r2);
// r1 and r2 are no longer used after this point

let r3 = &mut s; // it is no problem..!
println!("{}", r3);
```



### Dangling References

> A pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory.

In Rust, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references...!



```rust
// try to make dangling references
fn main() {
  let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
  let s = String::from("hello");
  &s
} // s goes out of scope and is dropped -> memory goes away
```

* Compiler occurs error : missing *lifetime* (Chapter 10) specifier.
