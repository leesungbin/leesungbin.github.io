# Common Programming Concepts with RUST



### Variables & Mutability

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 1;
  x = 2; // error, because x is immutable
  println!("x : {}", x);
  
	let mut y = 1;
  y = 2;
  println!("y : {}", y);
  
  const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
  // const에서는 mut 옵션을 사용할 수 없다.
}
```





### Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 1;
  let x = x + 2; // immutable 함이 계속 유지된다. 에러 발생 x
  let x = x * 2;
  
  println!("x : {}", x);
  
  let spaces = "    ";
  let spaces = spaces.len();
  
  
  let mut mutspaces = "   ";
  mutspaces = mutspaces.len(); // error, mutable한 것은 data 형식이 같아야한다.
}
```





### Data types

* Scalar types

  * Integer types

    i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize

    u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize

    isize / usize depends on the kind of computer

    > Note that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, and `_` as a visual separator, such as `1_000`.

    Integer overflow 발생시, debug mode에서는 panic 발생

    하지만, release 모드에서는 자동으로 그 값을 넘긴다. ex, u8, 256 -> 0, 257 -> 1

  * Floating-point types

    f32, f64 : default

  * Boolean type

    bool

  * Character type

    > Note that `char` literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.

* Compound types

  * Tuple type

    > Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    	  let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
        let (x, y, z) = tup;
        println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    }
    ```

    

    > we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the value we want to access.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
        let five_hundred = x.0;
        let six_point_four = x.1;
        let one = x.2;
    }
    ```

    

  * Array type

    > Unlike a tuple, **every element of an array must have the same type**. Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because **arrays in Rust have a fixed length**, like tuples.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    		let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
    	  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    	  let a = [3; 5];
      	// [3,3,3,3,3]
    }
    ```



> Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing.
