# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

* **Packages**: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
* **Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
* **Modules** and **use**: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
* **Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module



### Defining Modules to Contorl Scope and Privacy

```bash
cargo new --lib restaurant # to create a new library
```

```rust
// src/lib.rs
mod front_of_house {
  pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    
    fn seat_at_table() {}
  }
  mod serving {
    fn take_order() {}
    fn serve_order() {}
		fn take_payment() {}
  }
}

// public API
pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
  // Absolute path
  crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
  
  // Relative path
  front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```
