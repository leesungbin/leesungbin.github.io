# Functions

> Rust code uses *snake case* as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.



> If we define `another_function` *after* the `main` function, it doesn't matter. We could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.





### Pass parameters

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}

fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```





### Function Bodies Contain Statements and Expressions

> *Statements* are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

* function definitions are statements.

* let y = 6; is statement.

* Statement do not return values => can't assign let statement to another value

  ex) let x = (let y = 6); // x

  In Rust, such an expression "x = y = 6;"  can't happen.

* Expressions can be part of statements.

  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = {
      let x = 3;
      x + 1 // **do not include semicolon**
    }
    println!("y : {}", y); // y : 4
  }
  ```

  * Expressions do not include ending semicolons.

    -> If I put semicolon, then it doesn't return. It becomes statement.

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);
    
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
    
    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1  // ** don't put semicolon
      	// semicolon을 붙이면 나는 에러 : type 이 맞지 않는다는 것 : found type ()
    }
    ```
